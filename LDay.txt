Platform as a service
  - Cloud service providers have an opportunity to provide more than just the "basic"
    infrastructure.
  - PaaS includes a service layer on top of IaaS - computing, storage and networking.
  - middleware, development tools, database server, and more.

PaaS Computing
  - one example is Azure App Services
  - simply upload your code and configuration to azure, and it runs your code without needing
    to worry about the VM underneth.
  - Incudes scaling features, CI/CD, containers, staging and development environments, etc

PaaS storage
  - managed storage is an example of this
  - azure sql database is another example
  - freed from worring about the server vm itself or the hard disk itself

PaaS Networking
  - Azure front door is an example of this
  - Or Load Balancer
  - Or Firewall
  - These are software applications that perform networking tasks.

Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Cloud apps
  - Tools such as office 365, Onedrive, Skype
  - The app is ready to be used and simply need to set it up and use it


Serverless

What does 'Serverless' mean?
  - First, you don't manage the servers.
  - you only handle writing and running the code.

Serverless = Consumption-Based Pricing
  - you only pay for what you use.
  - No charges when your apps or database is idle.
  - No need to pre-purchase or reserve resources.

Serverless services:
  - Functions
  - Container Apps
  - Kubernetes
  - SQL Database
  - Cosmos DB
