Reliabilty Benefit of cloud computing

All three relating to high quality service
  - Availability
  - Reliability
  - Predictability

Availabilty
  The ability of a system to be accessible and usable by users
  when they need it.

Reliability
  The ability of a system to recover from failures.
  Azure has several built-in services that you can use to 
  keep an application running after a failure has occurred.

There are many different failures that can occur even in
a well-designed system.
  - Hardware failure 
  - Network interruptions
  - Power failures
  - Large-scale regional outage

Why Is It Needed?
 - You have to trust that your cloud provider is doing
   everything it can to make its platform reliable.
 - This includes transparency during service issues.

How Is It Achieved?
  - Auto-scaling.
  - Avoid single points of failure.
  - Multi-region deployments.
  - Data backup and replication.
  - Health probes and self-healing
