What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet 
("the Cloud"), which allows users to access resources like servers, 
storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics without having to
own or manage physical infrastructure.

1. Iaas - Infrastucture as a service.
   You manage most of it (like VMs, OS, apps). 
   Cloud Providers manages the underlying hardware.
   Examples: Azure VMs, Azure Storage, Azure virtual network.
   
   use when: you need full control over your environment and want to migrate
             traditional apps to the cloud.

2. Paas - Platform as a service.
   You manage only apps and data.
   The cloud provider handles the rest, including OS and runtime.
   Example: Azure APP Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions.
   
   use when: you want to develop applications quickly without managing the
             infrastructure.
   
3. Saas - Software as a service.
   Fully managed applications delivered over the internet. you just use
   the applications.
   Example: Microsoft 365 apps, GitHub, Salesforce.

   use when: you need ready-to-use software without worrying about how
             it works behind the scenes.

What Role does Azure play in cloud computing?
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and service provider that
delivers - Iaas, Paas, Saas.

  Cloud - Shared Responsibilty Model
  On Premises - ALL YOUR RESPONSIBILTY MODEL

1. Public Cloud
    The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third
    party providers over the public internet, make them avaiable to anyone
    who wants to use or purchase them.
    In the public cloud model, the cloud provider (e.g., Microsoft Azure) owns and
    manages the underlying infrastructure, including hardware, networking, 
    and data centers, which are shared among multiple tenants.
2. Private Cloud
   The private cloud is defined as computing services offered either over
   the internet or a private internal network and only to select users 
   instead of the general public.
   Looks and acts like a cloud, except customer owns or leases or has 
   exclusive access to the hardware.
   Microsoft Azure provide a private cloud called stack HCI that can rent
   and buy from them to use on your own hardware.
3. Hybrid Cloud
   computing environment with combine of both private and public cloud.
