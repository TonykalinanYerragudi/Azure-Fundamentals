Scalability benefit of cloud computing

The ability of a system to accommodate increasing demands by adding or 
removing resources as needed.

why is it needed?
It allows a system to adapt to changing usage patterns and handle
increased traffic without requiring changes to the application
code or system design.

Does traffic fluctuate?
- Some businesses have traffic that fluctuates based on time
of day or day of the year.
- E-commerce websites have black friday.
- school registrations are busy in september.
- Tax systems are busy in April.

The $1M Question...
- Can you expand the capacity of a system very easily, by
  adding more servers?
- Or will it be a massive undertaking to do that?

Vertical Scaling
  Also Called "Scaling up" or "Scaling down".
  Adding more resources to a single serve.
  Increase the amount of memory, the number of CPUs.
  There is an upper limit to this
  Azure - 96 vCPUs, 384 GB memory
  Does not improve availabilty

Horizontal Scaling
  Also called "scaling out" or "scaling in".
  Adding more servers to a system.
  No limit to scaling.
  Additional complexities for load balancing.

Impact on system cost
  Adding more resources to a system adds to cost.
  Reducing resources can reduce cost.
  Having scalable system allows for a system to be perfectly sized.
  This Optimizes the cost by reducing wasted computing resources.
