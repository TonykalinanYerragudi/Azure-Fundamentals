App Services, Containers and Azure Virtual Desktop

App Services (Web Apps): 
  - A new paradigm for running code in the cloud
  - Give your code and configuration to Azure and they will run it
  - Promise of performance but no access to hardware
  - Platform as a service (Paas)
  - Azure Container Instance (ACI) - single instance, quickest way to deploy
    a container.
  - Azure container Apps - easy to use like a web service, with advance
    features.
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - runs on a cluster of servers,
    enterprise-grade.

Azure Virtual Desktop:
  - Desktop version of windows that runs in the cloud
  - Your software installed, your files - available from anywhere
  - Can even see your desktop on iOS and Android, or from any web browser.
  - Runs on Azure

Azure Functions:
  - Small pieces of code that run entirely in the cloud
  - Utility function - does something specific in a finite amount of time.
  - Is triggered by something happening
    - Http call, timer, blob creation, message queue, ...other
  - very inexpensive

Azure Networking Services:
  - virtual networking in Azure
  - sometimes called VNets
  - Microsoft has an extensive global network of cables, swithes
    and routes - physical network
