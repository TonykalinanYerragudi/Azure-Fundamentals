Elasticity Benefit of cloud computing
The ability of a system to quickly and easily scale up or down
the amount of resources that a system uses in response to changing
demand.

- Has to involve some sort of automation.
- Often called "autoscaling" in cloud computing.
- The System monitors some metric (such as CPU utilization)
  to determine how busy a system is
- Adds resources when it exceeds a limit for being busy.
- Remove resources when it falls below a limit for being not
  busy.

Why Is It Needed?
  - More efficient and cost-effective use of resources.
  - Minimizes computing "waste" - resources paid for and not 
  - Self-hosted systems tend to have a large percentage of 
    "over-provisioned" resources for anticipated future growth.
