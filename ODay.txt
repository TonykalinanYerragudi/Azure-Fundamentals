Technical pillars of Azure

- Computing services
- networking services
- storage services
- Database services

Some of compute types of Azure

- Virtual Machines (VM)
- VM Scale Sets (VMSS)
- App services (Web apps)
- Azure container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure kubernetes service (AKS)
- Azure virtual desktop

Virtual Machines
  - This is the closest analogue to a "server" in cloud computing
  - But it's virtual
  - That is, a single physical machine has been subdivided into slices
    and you get to rent a single slice of it
  - IaaS

Scaling Azure VMs
  - you can increase the size of a VM easily, turning a 4 vCPU VM into
    an 8 vCPU VM in minutes (scale up)
    - can go to 64 vCPUs or higher
  - OR you can add more VMs and have them work together to handle
    the work (scale out)

Virtual Machine Scale Sets
  - A group of virtual machines that can grow and shrink in quantity
    based on a predefined rule.
  - Usually based on monitoring demand
  - Can be based on time (schedule)
  - Can be based on many other factors

Availabilty Sets
  - you have multiple virtual machines that have an identical functions
  - you want to signify to azure that they should be separated from each
    other in a certain way
